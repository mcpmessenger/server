# Development Recommendations for MCP Hub and MCP Server

This document provides an analysis of the `mcphub` (frontend) and `mcpserver` (backend) GitHub repositories and outlines actionable next steps for their respective development teams. The goal is to enhance functionality, improve stability, and streamline development workflows.

## 1. MCP Hub (Frontend) Analysis

**Repository:** [https://github.com/sentilabs01/mcphub](https://github.com/sentilabs01/mcphub)

**Key Technologies:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

**Current State & Observations:**

*   **LLM Integration:** All LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) now route through the backend for chat and key validation, which is a positive step for security and consistency.
*   **Provider Portals:** The UI has been cleaned up by removing the "Run a Command" section. API Key Testing is implemented for validation.
*   **Security:** API keys are not sent directly from the frontend to LLM providers, relying on the backend for proxying.
*   **Multi-Account Management:** UI exists for adding, removing, and setting active accounts, but the documentation notes that only single-token logic is currently reliable and "Active" account logic is not fully robust.
*   **Authentication:** Google OAuth via Supabase is working for app login and Google integrations.
*   **Integrations:** UI for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, GitHub, Google Drive, and Gmail is present. However, there are noted issues with token persistence for some providers (e.g., GitHub) in `localStorage`.
*   **Command Routing:** `/drive` and `/gmail` commands route to MCP servers using the Supabase session token, but require correct `mcp_servers` entries in Supabase.
*   **Command History:** Up/down arrow navigation is implemented in the ChatBar.
*   **MCP Server Discovery:** Relies on the `mcp_servers` table in Supabase, with potential errors if entries are missing or duplicated.
*   **Token Persistence Issues:** A recurring theme is the unreliability of token saving to `localStorage` for certain providers, leading to command failures.
*   **Supabase Token Expiry:** Google access tokens (`provider_token`) from Supabase may expire or be missing, indicating a need for robust token refresh.
*   **UI/UX:** Some status/error messages are missing or unclear; account management UI is still evolving.
*   **Command Routing Fallback:** Some commands default to OpenAI if MCP server lookup fails.
