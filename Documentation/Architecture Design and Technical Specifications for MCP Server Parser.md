# Architecture Design and Technical Specifications for MCP Server Parser

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the proposed architecture design and technical specifications for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server parser, encompassing both the frontend client and backend server components. The goal is to establish a robust, scalable, and user-friendly system that facilitates seamless integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with various external data sources and tools, adhering to the Model Context Protocol. This design incorporates insights from the initial repository analysis of `mcpserver` and `mcphub`, as well as the market analysis, to address existing challenges and leverage emerging opportunities in the AI integration landscape.

## 2. Overall System Architecture

The MCP server parser system will follow a clear client-server architecture, with the `mcphub` acting as the frontend client and the `mcpserver` as the backend service. Communication between these components, and with external LLMs and services, will be governed by the Model Context Protocol. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for future additions of AI providers, integrations, and functionalities.

**Components:**

*   **MCP Hub (Frontend Client):** A React-based web application providing the user interface for interacting with the MCP system. It will handle user authentication, display available commands and integrations, manage user accounts, and present the results of LLM interactions and workflows.
*   **MCP Server (Backend Service):** A Node.js (Express) application responsible for orchestrating LLM interactions, managing integrations with external services (GitHub, Google Drive, Gmail, etc.), parsing natural language commands, executing chained workflows, and handling API key validation and routing.
*   **LLM Providers:** External Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) that the MCP server communicates with to perform AI-driven tasks like chat, summarization, and code generation.
*   **External Services:** Third-party applications and platforms (e.g., GitHub, Google Drive, Gmail, Zapier) that the MCP server integrates with to access data and perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Database:** A persistent storage solution (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for storing user data, integration tokens, MCP server configurations, and potentially command history and workflow definitions.
