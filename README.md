# Slash / MCP Server â€“ Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## ðŸš€ Installation & Quick-Start (Local Dev)

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js â‰¥ 20** and **npm â‰¥ 9** (or pnpm/yarn)
- **Git** (to clone the repo) â€“ or download the full source zip including `backend/`, `src/`, `services/`, `providers/` folders.

### 1 â€“ Clone & install
```bash
# grab the code
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mcp-server.git
cd mcp-server/project

# install front-end + workspace deps (root package.json)
npm install

# install backend-specific deps	npm install --prefix backend
```

### 2 â€“ Configure environment
Copy `.env.example` â†’ `.env` and fill in at least the values marked **(required)**:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```
Key vars for a first run:
```env
# â”€â”€â”€ Front-end (Vite) â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=stub
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=stub

# â”€â”€â”€ Back-end (Express) â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here           # optional if you just explore the UI
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173     # allow Vite dev server
SESSION_SECRET=dev-secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) # 64-char hex
```

### 3 â€“ Run dev servers (two tabs)
```bash
# tab 1 â€“ front-end (Vite + React)
npm run dev              # or pnpm run dev

# tab 2 â€“ back-end (Express)
npm run dev:backend      # = cd backend && npm start
```
Visit http://localhost:5173 â€“ the admin UI talks to the backend on port 3001.

>  Tip: `npm run dev:all` starts both processes concurrently.

### 4 â€“ Build for production
```bash
npm run build      # front-end â†’ dist/
# serve dist/ with any static server & keep backend running with pm2/systemd
```

## ðŸŒŸ Why use MCP Messenger Server?
1. **Unified AI layer** â€“ OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini & more via one `/api/chat` contract.
2. **Plug-in providers** â€“ GitHub, Gmail, Slack, Jira, Notion, Driveâ€¦ drop-in JS modules under `backend/providers/`.
3. **Secure credential vault** â€“ AES-256-GCM encryption + SQLite/Supabase DAO.
4. **Chained workflows** â€“ Parse natural language into multi-step provider commands.
5. **Batteries included UI** â€“ React admin panel for keys, OAuth connects, request history.
6. **Dev-friendly** â€“ Vite hot-reload, CORS allow-list via `CORS_ORIGINS`.

## 1. Vision

## Chained Commands & API

### Overview
Chained commands allow apps or users to combine multiple actions in a single workflow, where the output of one command becomes the input for the next. This enables complex, multi-step tasks to be performed with a single API call or through a visual builder.

### User Value
- Automates repetitive or multi-step tasks.
- Saves time and reduces manual effort.
- Enables advanced use cases (e.g., summarize a document, then translate the summary).

### Example Use Cases
- "Summarize this PDF and then translate it to Spanish."
- "Fetch the latest GitHub issues, summarize them, and email the summary to my team."
- "Extract text from an image, then run sentiment analysis."

### Supported Chains
- Summarize â†’ Translate
- Fetch Issues â†’ Summarize â†’ Email
- Extract Text â†’ Analyze Sentiment

### Error Handling
- If a step fails, the user/app is notified with a clear error message.
- The user/app can view which step failed and retry or edit the chain.

### Chained Command API/GUI

**Key Features:**
- **API for Chained Commands:**
  - Apps can POST a workflow (array of steps) to `/api/workflow`.
  - Each step specifies provider, command, prompt, and (optionally) API key.
- **(Optional) Command Builder Modal/Panel:**
  - Users can visually add, remove, and reorder steps in a workflow.
  - Each step is represented as a card or block with editable parameters.
- **Inline Chaining in Chat:**
  - Users can type chained commands naturally; the system parses and displays the steps visually above the input.
  - Users can click to edit the chain in the builder modal.
- **Execution Feedback:**
  - Progress bar or step tracker shows which step is running, completed, or failed.
  - Users can expand/collapse to view intermediate results.

**User Flow:**
1. App or user sends a chained command or opens the builder.
2. System parses and displays the steps.
3. User/app reviews/edits the steps.
4. User/app clicks "Run."
5. API/UI shows progress and results for each step.

## External Automation Connectors (n8n, Make.com, Zapier)

The project now ships with first-class, open-source connectors that let anyone orchestrate MCP commands and workflows in their favorite no-code tools.

| Platform | Location in Repo | What's Included |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **n8n**  | `integrations/n8n-nodes-mcp/` | Custom node **MCP** with `Command` & `Workflow` resources and credential type (Base URL + optional API key). Build via `npm run build` and install inside your n8n instance with `npm i n8n-nodes-mcp`. |
| **Make.com** | `integrations/makecom/mcp-app.json` | Importable JSON definition exposing *Execute Command* & *Execute Workflow* actions. |
| **Zapier** | `integrations/zapier-mcp/` | Zapier Platform CLI app with custom auth, ping trigger, and the same two actions. Deploy with `zapier push`. |

All three connectors share the identical credential model:

* **Base URL** â€“ root of your MCP server (e.g. `https://api.my-mcp.com`)
* **API Key** â€“ optional; include only if your instance enforces key-based auth

### Quickstart

```
# n8n (inside your n8n container / directory)
npm i n8n-nodes-mcp && n8n restart

# Make.com
# 1. Open Make.com âžœ Apps âžœ Create Custom App âžœ Import JSON
# 2. Paste the contents of integrations/makecom/mcp-app.json

# Zapier
npm i -g zapier-platform-cli
cd integrations/zapier-mcp
npm install
zapier login
zapier push   # follow prompts to create a private version
```

See the individual READMEs in each folder for more details.

## Claude Desktop Integration â€“ Quick Start

```README.md

```

### Built-in Zapier Provider (AI Actions)

MCP Server now supports Zapier **AI Actions (NLA)** natively via the `/api/command` endpoint.

1. In Zapier, open your Zap âžœ **AI Actions** panel âžœ enable **Expose this Zap to AI** âžœ *Publish* the Zap so it's **On**.
2. Generate an AI-Actions API key (it starts with `sk-nla-` or legacy `sk-ak-`).
3. Call MCP with `provider="zapier"` and the key in the body (`apiKey`) or an `Authorization: Bearer â€¦` header.

```bash
# List AI-enabled Zaps
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"provider":"zapier","command":"list-zaps","apiKey":"<ZAPIER_NLA_KEY>"}' \
     http://localhost:3001/api/command

# Trigger a Zap (replace <ID> with one returned from list-zaps)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"provider":"zapier","command":"trigger zap <ID>","apiKey":"<ZAPIER_NLA_KEY>"}' \
     http://localhost:3001/api/command
```

The server converts both requests into calls to Zapier's NLA endpoints:
* `list-zaps`  â†’ `GET https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/ai_zaps/`
* `trigger zap <id>` â†’ `POST https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/ai_zaps/<id>/execute/`

All responses (including errors) are returned as JSON, making them safe to consume from the front-end or other automations.

---

## Jira Integration (OAuth 2.0 3-LO)

The MCP Server now supports Atlassian Jira Cloud commands out-of-the-box.

### Supported slash commands

| UI slash                                           | Prompt slug      | Description                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `/jira list projects`                              | `list-projects`  | List accessible Jira projects      |
| `/jira list issues`                                | `list-issues`    | Recent issues (default *assigned*) |
| `/jira get issue ABC-123`                          | `get-issue ABC-123` | Full issue JSON                   |
| `/jira create issue KEY "Summary"`                | `create-issue KEY "Summary"` | Create new issue   |
| `/jira update issue ABC-123  â€¦`                    | `update-issue ABC-123 â€¦` | Update fields (JSON body)        |
| `/jira add comment ABC-123 "â€¦"`                   | `add-comment ABC-123 "â€¦"` | Append comment & return id       |
| `/jira transition issue ABC-123 Done`              | `transition-issue ABC-123 Done` | Move issue to status        |

### Backend env-vars ( `project/backend/.env` )

```
PORT=3001                         # keep 3001 for Google + Jira in dev
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_ID=<app id>
ATLASSIAN_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>  # if confidential mode enabled
JIRA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001/api/auth/jira/callback
JIRA_SCOPES=read:jira-work write:jira-work offline_access
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5174,http://localhost:5173
```

### Atlassian developer-console set-up
1. OAuth 2.0 (3-LO) app â†’ Authorisation â†’ **Redirect URIs** â†’ add the value of `JIRA_REDIRECT_URI`.
2. Copy the **Client ID** + **Secret** into `.env`.
3. Grant the scopes shown above (or a subset) and *Save*.

### Supabase row
Update the `mcp_servers` table so Jira points at the correct port in dev:

```sql
update mcp_servers
set    apiurl = 'http://localhost:3001'
where  id = 'jira';
```

(Production deployments should point to the public MCP Server URL.)

After these steps "Connect Jira" in the Integrations portal opens the Atlassian consent screen; once accepted the badge flips to **Connected** and slash commands work via the MCP protocol.
