# Product Requirements Document: MCP Hub Connector Implementation (Backend Team)

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the requirements for the backend team to implement new Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors within the MCP Hub platform. The goal is to expand the platform's integration capabilities, enhance workflow automation, and provide users with seamless connectivity to a wider range of essential business and development tools. This document is intended for the backend development team to guide the implementation process.

## 2. Connector Prioritization and Rationale

### 2.1. Zapier and Make.com (Automation Platforms)

**Description:** Both Zapier and Make.com are leading no-code/low-code automation platforms that enable users to connect various web applications and automate workflows. MCP Hub already has explicit support and documentation for these platforms, indicating existing foundational work.

**Rationale:**

> "High leverage due to extensive third-party integrations, existing foundational support, and a clear path to showcase MCP's value as an automation hub. This can be highly motivating for teams as they see their work enable a vast ecosystem."

Integrating deeply with Zapier and Make.com will significantly extend the reach of MCP Hub, allowing users to orchestrate complex workflows involving thousands of applications. This demonstrates MCP Hub's power as a central orchestration layer and provides immense value to users seeking comprehensive automation solutions.

**Backend Requirements:**

*   **API Integration:** Ensure robust API endpoints for interacting with Zapier and Make.com. This includes handling authentication (API keys, OAuth if applicable), command routing, and response parsing.
*   **Provider Module:** Develop or enhance the `zapier` and `makecom` provider modules within `backend/providers/`, exposing `id`, `supportedCommands`, and `executeCommand` functions.
*   **Workflow Execution:** Support the execution of Zapier and Make.com workflows, including the ability to pass context from MCP Hub commands to these external platforms.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls to Zapier and Make.com, ensuring that failures are gracefully managed and reported back to the frontend.
*   **Security:** Securely store and manage API keys and credentials for Zapier and Make.com, leveraging existing encryption and token management mechanisms.

### 2.2. n8n (Open-Source Automation Platform)

**Description:** n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform, offering a powerful alternative to commercial solutions like Zapier and Make.com. The `mcpserver` already includes an n8n custom node, providing a strong foundation for integration.

**Rationale:**

> "Aligns with open-source philosophy, provides an alternative to commercial automation platforms, and can foster community engagement."

Supporting n8n aligns with MCP Hub's focus on open and free tools, and can appeal to a segment of users who prefer self-hosted or open-source solutions.

**Backend Requirements:**

*   **API Integration:** Develop robust API endpoints for interacting with n8n, handling authentication and command routing.
*   **Provider Module:** Create an `n8n` provider module within `backend/providers/`, exposing `id`, `supportedCommands`, and `executeCommand` functions.
*   **Workflow Execution:** Support the execution of n8n workflows, including passing context from MCP Hub commands.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls to n8n.
*   **Security:** Securely store and manage API keys and credentials for n8n.

### 2.3. Notion, Slack, Jira (Roadmap Items)

**Description:** Notion, Slack, and Jira are widely used business tools for collaboration, communication, and project management. Integrating with these platforms will significantly expand the utility of MCP Hub for enterprise users.

**Rationale:**

> "High demand in business environments, expands the platform's use cases, and presents interesting technical challenges that can keep the team engaged."

Integrating with these tools will demonstrate MCP Hub's ability to integrate with enterprise-level tools, addressing a high demand in business environments and presenting engaging technical challenges for the team.

**Backend Requirements:**

*   **API Integration:** Develop robust API endpoints for interacting with Notion, Slack, and Jira, handling authentication (e.g., OAuth flows, API tokens), command routing, and response parsing.
*   **Provider Modules:** Create dedicated provider modules within `backend/providers/` for Notion, Slack, and Jira, each exposing `id`, `supportedCommands`, and `executeCommand` functions.
*   **Command Implementation:** Implement specific commands for each platform (e.g., for Slack: `list channels`, `send message`; for Jira: `create issue`, `list issues`; for Notion: `create page`, `list pages`).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls to Notion, Slack, and Jira.
*   **Security:** Securely store and manage API keys and credentials for Notion, Slack, and Jira.

## 3. General Backend Considerations

*   **Modularity:** Maintain the modular design of `mcpserver`. New connectors should be plug-and-play, minimizing impact on existing codebases.
*   **Security:** Prioritize secure handling of API keys and tokens. Leverage existing encryption and authentication mechanisms (e.g., Supabase, OAuth).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and clear, user-friendly error messages.
*   **Performance:** Optimize connector performance to ensure a smooth user experience, especially for commands that involve external API calls.
*   **Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new backend components related to these connectors.
*   **Provider Plug-ins:** Follow the `backend/providers/*.js` template for new providers, exposing `{ id, supportedCommands, executeCommand }`.
*   **Command Parsing:** Leverage the existing smart intent parsing and chained command parsing logic to integrate new commands seamlessly.
*   **Database Interactions:** Use the SQLite database for per-user integration tokens, adhering to existing data models and encryption practices.
*   **API Design:** Design clear and consistent API endpoints for new connector functionalities, following RESTful principles where applicable.
*   **Scalability:** Consider the scalability of new integrations, especially for those that might involve high volumes of requests or data.
